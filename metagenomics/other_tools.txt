Other available **metagenomics** tools are:

**Fetch taxonomic representation**
  fetches taxonomic information for a list of GI numbers (sequences identifiers used by the National Center for Biotechnology Information http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov).

**Filter taxonomy data**
  filters Taxonomy Datafile according to the relative abundance.

**Summarize taxonomy**
  computes a summary of all taxonomic ranks for the given taxonomic representation.

**Draw phylogeny**
  produces a graphical representations of phylogenetic tree in PDF format.

**Find diagonistic hits**
  takes data generated by Taxonomy manipulation->Fetch Taxonomic Ranks as input and outputs either a list of sequence reads unique to a particular taxonomic rank, or a list of taxonomic ranks and the count of unique reads corresponding to each rank.

**Find lowest diagnostic rank**
  identifies the lowest taxonomic rank for which a mategenomic sequencing read is diagnostic. It takes datasets produced by Fetch Taxonomic Ranks tool (aka Taxonomy format) as the input.

**Poisson two-sample test**
  checks if the number of reads that fall in a particular taxon in location 1 is different from those that fall in the same taxon in location 2.
