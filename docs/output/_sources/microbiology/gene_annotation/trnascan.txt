tRNAscan
========

tRNAscan-SE was designed to make rapid, sensitive **searches of genomic sequence** feasible using the selectivity of the Cove analysis package. We have optimized search sensitivity with eukaryote cytoplasmic and eubacterial sequences, but it may be applied more broadly with a slight reduction in sensitivity .
