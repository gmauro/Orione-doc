Mugsy
=====

Mugsy is a **multiple whole genome alignment** tool.


Details
-------

Mugsy generates a MAF (multiple alignment format) file containing the multiple alignments from FASTA inputs. 

This implementation runs with two files only: reference vs contigs/draft(s). For multiple alignment a single Multi-FASTA file containing all contigs should be provided.
