miRDeep2 is a software package which can be used for identification of novel and known miRNAs in deep sequencing data and for miRNA expression profiling across samples.

Here miRDeep2 is coupled with the SeqTrimMap algorithm that maps reads using a sequential trimming strategy which allows an efficient mapping of short reads.

This tool uses miRDeep2 and SeqTrimMap, which are licensed separately.
