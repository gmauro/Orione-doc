MACS14
======

This tool allows ChIP-seq peak calling using MACS.

Depending upon selected options, 2 to 6 history items will be created; the first output will be a standard BED file and the last will be an HTML report containing links to download additional files generated by MACS. Up to two each of wig and interval files can be optionally created; the interval files are parsed from the xls output.
