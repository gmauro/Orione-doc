===========================
Filter combined transcripts
===========================


The tool uses a tracking file (produced by cuffcompare) to filter a GTF file of transcripts (usually the transcripts produced by cufflinks). Filtering is done by extracting transcript IDs from tracking file and then filtering the GTF so that the output GTF contains only transcript found in the tracking file. Because a tracking file has multiple samples, a sample number is used to filter transcripts for a particular sample.
