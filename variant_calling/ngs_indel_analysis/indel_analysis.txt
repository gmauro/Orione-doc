Indel analysis
==============


Given an input sam file, this tool provides analysis of the indels. It filters out matches that do not meet the frequency threshold. The way this frequency of occurence is calculated is different for deletions and insertions. The CIGAR string's "M" can indicate an exact match or a mismatch.
