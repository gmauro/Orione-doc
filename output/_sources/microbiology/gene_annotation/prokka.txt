Prokka
======


Prokka is a software tool to annotate bacterial, archaeal and viral genomes very rapidly, and produce output files that require only minor tweaking to submit to Genbank/ENA/DDBJ.


Details
-------

Prokka creates several output files:

**gff**
  This is the master annotation in GFF3 format, containing both sequences and annotations. It can be viewed directly in Artemis or IGV.

**gbk**
  This is a standard Genbank file derived from the master .gff. If the input to prokka was a multi-FASTA, then this will be a multi-Genbank, with one record for each sequence.

**fna**
  Nucleotide FASTA file of the input contig sequences.

**faa**
  Protein FASTA file of the translated CDS sequences.

**ffn**
  Nucleotide FASTA file of all the annotated sequences, not just CDS.

**sqn**
  An ASN1 format "Sequin" file for submission to Genbank. It needs to be edited to set the correct taxonomy, authors, related publication etc.

**fsa**
  Nucleotide FASTA file of the input contig sequences, used by **tbl2asn** to create the ``.sqn`` file. It is mostly the same as the ``.fna`` file, but with extra Sequin tags in the sequence description lines.

**tbl**
  Feature Table file, used by **tbl2asn** to create the ``.sqn`` file.

**err**
  Unacceptable annotations - the NCBI discrepancy report.

**log**
  Contains all the output that Prokka produced during its run. This is a record of what settings you used.
