SSPACE
======

Overview
--------

SSPACE is a stand-alone program for scaffolding pre-assembled contigs using paired-read data. It is unique in offering the possibility to manually control the scaffolding process. By using the distance information of paired-end and/or matepair data, SSPACE is able to assess the order, distance and orientation of your contigs and combine them into scaffolds. The input data is given by pre-assembled contig sequences (FASTA) and NGS paired-read data (FASTA or FASTQ). The final scaffolds are provided in FASTA format.
