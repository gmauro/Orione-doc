Overview
--------

Velvet is a de novo genomic assembler specially designed for short read sequencing technologies, such as Solexa or 454.

Velvet currently takes in short read sequences, removes errors then produces high quality unique contigs. It then uses paired-end read and long read information, when available, to retrieve the repeated areas between contigs.


Details
-------

Velvet consists of two parts:

Velveth
  takes in a number of sequence files, produces a hashtable, then outputs two files in an output directory (creating it if necessary), Sequences and Roadmaps, which are necessary to velvetg.

Velvetg
  can input sequence files in the following formats: fasta fastq fasta.gz fastq.gz eland gerald.

The input files are prepared for the velvet assembler using velveth.
