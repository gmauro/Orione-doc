Glimmer is a system for **finding genes in microbial DNA**, especially the genomes of bacteria, archaea, and viruses. Glimmer, **Gene Locator and Interpolated Markov ModelER**, uses interpolated Markov models (IMMs) to identify the coding regions and distinguish them from noncoding DNA. The IMM approach uses a combination of Markov models from 1st through 8th-order, weighting each model according to its predictive power. Glimmer uses 3-periodic nonhomogenous Markov models in its IMMs. 


Details
-------

Glimmer3 is presented as a suite of programs that can be used independently:

Long-ORFs
  identifies long, non-overlapping open reading frames (ORFs) in a DNA sequence file.

Extract
  reads FASTA-format *sequence-file* and extract from it the subsequences specified by *coords*.

Build-ICM
  produces a probability model of coding sequences, called an interpolated context model or ICM.

Glimmer
  reads DNA sequences in *sequence-file* and predict genes in them using the Interpolated Context Model. Outputs are a detail file and a prediction file.

Anomaly
  reads DNA sequence in *sequence-file* and for each region specified by the coordinates in *coords*, check whether the region represents a normal gene, i.e., it begins with a start codon, ends with a stop codon, and has no frame shifts.
